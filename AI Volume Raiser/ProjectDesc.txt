AI-Powered Volume Control Using Hand Gestures
This script utilizes computer vision and AI to control the volume of your audio playback device using hand gestures. It uses the mediapipe library for hand detection and pycaw for audio volume control. The script captures video from your webcam, detects the position of your thumb and index finger, calculates the distance between them, and adjusts the volume accordingly.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV
MediaPipe
PyCaw
Comtypes


Explanation
-----------
Camera Initialization: The script starts by initializing the webcam using cv2.VideoCapture(0).

Hand Detection Setup: It sets up MediaPipe for hand detection with mp.solutions.hands.

Volume Control Setup: It accesses the speaker and volume control functionalities using the PyCaw library.

Main Loop:
Captures frames from the webcam.
Converts the frame to RGB and processes it to detect hands.
If hands are detected, it extracts the landmarks for the thumb and index finger.
Calculates the distance between the thumb and index finger.
Maps this distance to the volume range and adjusts the system volume accordingly.

Exit Conditions: The loop runs indefinitely until the spacebar is pressed, at which point it releases the webcam and closes all OpenCV windows.

This setup allows for intuitive and contactless control of the audio volume using simple hand gestures.
